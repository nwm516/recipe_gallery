# On viewing the Recipe Gallery
Within your IDE, navigate to where the React application folder holding the recipe gallery application. In the terminal, type in "npm start" and the file should begin operating.

# On layout and styling choices
I have very light styling choices in the RecipeGallery.css file, mostly to keep the recipes in a horizontal alignment versus having the need to scroll to see them all.
I also implemented style-components, mostly to get a taste for what they were capable of. Those changes from styled-components mostly affect text and image stylings.
